In this community, Kruisy Kroc holders will gain access to the private discord channels that will have alpha calls; as well as the ability to vote for where you want the direction of the KrocDAO to go in the future. This extends from voting how the community funds are used. E.g. deciding which Blue Chip NFTs investment to buy to real life ventures.'
